# RSA Algorithm in Cryptography
RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.
An example of asymmetric cryptography :
1.	A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
2.	The server encrypts the data using client’s public key and sends the encrypted data.
3.	Client receives this data and decrypts it.
Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has public key of browser.
The idea! The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.

# AES
AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution–permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).

Interestingly, AES performs all its computations on bytes rather than bits. Hence, AES treats the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16 bytes. These 16 bytes are arranged in four columns and four rows for processing as a matrix −

Unlike DES, the number of rounds in AES is variable and depends on the length of the key. AES uses 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. Each of these rounds uses a different 128-bit round key, which is calculated from the original AES key.

# SHA-256
SHA-256 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm – 256 bit and is a type of hash function commonly used in Blockchain. A hash function is a type of mathematical function which turns data into a fingerprint of that data called a hash. It’s like a formula or algorithm which takes the input data and turns it into an output of a fixed length, which represents the fingerprint of the data.

The input data can literally be any data, whether it’s the entire Encyclopedia Britannica, or just the number ‘1’. A hash function will give the same hash for the same input always no matter when, where and how you run the algorithm. Equally interestingly, if even one character in the input text or data is changed, the output hash will change. Also, a hash function is a one-way function, thus it is impossible to generate back the input data from its hash. So, you can go from the input data to the hash but not from the hash to the input data.
